== Description ==
 
This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).
 

== Installation ==
 
1. Install SeatReg either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.

  
== Screenshots ==
 
1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

"installation."  Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.

Titles are optional, naturally.

"Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"
 
Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.
 
`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
